# TypeScript OO

This repository contains practical examples and exercises for learning TypeScript. Each .ts file represents a study, focusing on specific language concepts. In addition to type safety and functional programming features, the project also explores object-oriented programming (OOP) in TypeScript â€” including classes, inheritance, access modifiers, abstract classes, and more.
